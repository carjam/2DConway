To run:
1) Make sure you have python3 installed.
2) If you don't already have it, you'll need to install numpy: 'pip3 install numpy'
3) From the unix command line run: "python3 Solution.py"
    This will run the solution over each of the three test cases in numeric order, followed by running the twenty iteration given case.
